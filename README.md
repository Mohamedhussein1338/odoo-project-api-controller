# odoo-project-api-controller
(odoo 16)

Description:
This repository contains an Odoo controller named ProjectApiController, which serves as an API endpoint for creating records in the 'project.api' model. The controller receives POST requests containing JSON data, extracts the relevant fields, logs the received data, and then creates a new record in the model. It demonstrates how to implement a simple API endpoint in Odoo for data creation.

Features:

1-Implements a custom HTTP controller in Odoo for handling POST requests.


2-Extracts JSON data from the request and creates records in the 'project.api' model.
